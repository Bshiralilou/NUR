\section{(2.c)}
For the differentiation we have used the Ridder's method as it can give very accurate results in few computational steps.\\
The truncation error at each step $n$ of the calculatios is $\approx O(h^{2(n-1)})$

The numerical and analytical differentiation at $x=b$, for the random parameters a, b and c as before, are shown below. The results are comparable up to 13 significant digits.
