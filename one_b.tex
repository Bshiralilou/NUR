\section{(1.b)}
The parameters for the function rand() below are adopted from the Numerical Recipes book. After testing combinations of random generators A with C/D ( as stated in the book), we chose the combination A1C1 as the optimized choice.

As the Fig. 1 shows, the generated numbers are uncorrelated and well randomly distributed but some of the spots are not generated well. (sadly!\\
As Fig. 2 shows, all the numbers in the bins are produced almost equally probable.
