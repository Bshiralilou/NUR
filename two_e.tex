\section{(2.e)}
In Fig. \ref{fig:fig4} we can see the result of the sampling from the code below, over plotted with the distribution.\\
Unfortunately the distributions do not match at very low and very high values of x. This might be due to the random generator that we have used.\footnote{But I could not make it better :(}
