\section{(1.a)}

The code below gives the Poisson distribution for integer k.\\
Since we know that multiplication and division are computationally more inaccurate than summation and subtraction, we compute the logarithm of the distribution and then translate it back.\\
The memory limit is performed on 'mean' and 'k' inside the function.

The results for the pairs $(\lambda, k)= (1,0) , (5,10) ,  (3,21) , (2.6,40), (101,200)$ are as follows:
